### 0x01. ES6 Promises
In this repository, I learn about Promises in JavaScript (ES6).

Some of the concepts covered in this repository are:
- JavaScript Promises
- States of a JavaScript Promise:
  - Pending
  - Fulfilled
  - Rejected
- Static Methods of JavaScript Promises
    - `all()`
    - `allSettled()`
    - `race()`
    - `reject()`
    - `resolve()`
- Chained Promises
- Resolving Promises:
    - Returning Resolved Promises with `.this()`
    - Returning Rejected Promises with `.catch()`
